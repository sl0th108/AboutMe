        <div class="firstText">Hi my name is Bowen Condelario, I am eighteen years old and I am from casper wyoming. I have many goals in life but I would say my biggest ambition is to one day make a game that makes people happy, when I was a kid not many people liked me so i felt alone and sad a lot during my middle school years but when my family got a Xbox 360 for Christmas I became infatuated with games and it brought me the joy I was missing in my life so I decided I want to give that sort of joy to someone else who might need it.</div>
